    "You are developing a solution to process receipt images using the Document Intelligence API.",
    "After uploading the images, the API returns a JSON response with extracted data, including various fields and their confidence scores.",
    "To ensure the accuracy of the extracted information, you need to establish a criterion that triggers a manual review by a designated team if any of the confidence scores for the extracted fields fall below a certain threshold.",
    "Given the JSON structure shown below, which expression should you use to trigger a manual review?",

  ],
  "correctAnswer": "c",
  "explanation": "To trigger manual review when any extracted field has a confidence score below a threshold, you need to check all fields dynamically. The expression 'documentResults.fields.*.confidence less than 0.7' captures this by evaluating all confidence values in the fields object."
